This is Prof. Weixing Ji’s home on the web!

I am a professor in the School of Computer Science and Technology at the Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT). I received my B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the School of Computer Science and Technology, the Beijing Institute of Technology, in 2003 and 2008, respectively. I visited the Department of Computer Science at the University of Rochester in the United States from March 2012 to March 2013.

My research interests include computer architecture, parallel and high-performance computing, compilation optimization, and code analysis. My work is partly funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the National Key Research and Development Program of China.

I am always looking for self-motivated students to work with me. Contact me by email if you are interested in my research interests.
